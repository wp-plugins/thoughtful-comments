[Usage](http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/thoughtful-comments/usage/)

== Installation ==

Just copy the plugin directory into your Wordpress plugins directory (usually wp-content/plugins) and activate it in Wordpress admin panel.

You can modify the CSS file in the plugin (/wp-content/plugins/thoughtful-comments/css/frontend.css) to change the styling of plugin action links and the highlights.

== Theme compatibility ==

If you want to get the most correct display when deleting a comment and preserving it's replies, you need to use a theme which is using "cascade" display of the comments instead of "nested" display. 

Thoughtful Comments assumes that each comment is contained in some HTML element with unique ID which is containing the comment ID, so it works with most of the themes.


== Screenshots ==

1. The front end comment moderation which editor and admin users are able to see and use.
2. Number of unapproved comments shown for editor and admin users in the frontend. The number is highlighted as there are some unapproved comments and there's a tooltip.
3. Per-user moderation settings.
